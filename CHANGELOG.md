# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

NOTE: As semantic versioning states all 0.y.z releases can contain breaking changes in API (flags, grpc API, any backward compatibility)

We use *breaking* word for marking changes that are not backward compatible (relates only to v0.y.z releases.)

## Unreleased.

### Added

- [#1358](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1358) Added `part_size` configuration option for HTTP multipart requests minimum part size for S3 storage type

### Changed

- [#1338](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1338) Querier still warns on store API duplicate, but allows a single one from duplicated set. This is gracefully warn about the problematic logic and not disrupt immediately.
- [#1297](https://github.com/improbable-eng/thanos/pull/1297) Added `/-/ready` and `/-/healthy` endpoints to Thanos compact.

### Fixed

- [#1327](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1327) `/series` API end-point now properly returns an empty array just like Prometheus if there are no results

- [#1302](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1302) Thanos now efficiently reuses HTTP keep-alive connections

## [v0.6.0](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/releases/tag/v0.6.0) - 2019.07.18

### Added

- [#1097](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1097) Added `thanos check rules` linter for Thanos rule rules files.

- [#1253](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1253) Add support for specifying a maximum amount of retries when using Azure Blob storage (default: no retries).

- [#1244](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1244) Thanos Compact now exposes new metrics `thanos_compact_downsample_total` and `thanos_compact_downsample_failures_total` which are useful to catch when errors happen

- [#1260](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1260) Thanos Query/Rule now exposes metrics `thanos_querier_store_apis_dns_provider_results` and `thanos_ruler_query_apis_dns_provider_results` which tell how many addresses were configured and how many were actually discovered respectively

- [#1248](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1248) Add a web UI to show the state of remote storage.

- [#1217](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1217) Thanos Receive gained basic hashring support

- [#1262](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1262) Thanos Receive got a new metric `thanos_http_requests_total` which shows how many requests were handled by it

- [#1243](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1243) Thanos Receive got an ability to forward time series data between nodes. Now you can pass the hashring configuration via `--receive.hashrings-file`; the refresh interval `--receive.hashrings-file-refresh-interval`; the name of the local node's name `--receive.local-endpoint`; and finally the header's name which is used to determine the tenant `--receive.tenant-header`.

- [#1147](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1147) Support for the Jaeger tracer has been added!

*breaking* New common flags were added for configuring tracing: `--tracing.config-file` and `--tracing.config`. You can either pass a file to Thanos with the tracing configuration or pass it in the command line itself. Old `--gcloudtrace.*` flags were removed :warning:

To migrate over the old `--gcloudtrace.*` configuration, your tracing configuration should look like this:

```yaml

---
type: STACKDRIVER
config:
- service_name: 'foo'
  project_id: '123'
  sample_factor: 123
```

The other `type` you can use is `JAEGER` now. The `config` keys and values are Jaeger specific and you can find all of the information [here](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-go#environment-variables).

### Changed

- [#1284](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1284) Add support for multiple label-sets in Info gRPC service. 
This deprecates the single `Labels` slice of the `InfoResponse`, in a future release backward compatible handling for the single set of Labels will be removed. Upgrading to v0.6.0 or higher is advised.
*breaking* If you run have duplicate queries in your Querier configuration with hierarchical federation of multiple Queries this PR makes Thanos Querier to detect this case and block all duplicates. Refer to 0.6.1 which at least allows for single replica to work.

- [#1314](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1314) Removes `http_request_duration_microseconds` (Summary) and adds `http_request_duration_seconds` (Histogram) from http server instrumentation used in Thanos APIs and UIs.

- [#1287](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1287) Sidecar now waits on Prometheus' external labels before starting the uploading process

- [#1261](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1261) Thanos Receive now exposes metrics `thanos_http_request_duration_seconds` and `thanos_http_response_size_bytes` properly of each handler

- [#1274](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1274) Iteration limit has been lifted from the LRU cache so there should be no more spam of error messages as they were harmless

- [#1321](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1321) Thanos Query now fails early on a query which only uses external labels - this improves clarity in certain situations

### Fixed

- [#1227](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1227) Some context handling issues were fixed in Thanos Compact; some unnecessary memory allocations were removed in the hot path of Thanos Store.

- [#1183](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1183) Compactor now correctly propagates retriable/haltable errors which means that it will not unnecessarily restart if such an error occurs

- [#1231](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1231) Receive now correctly handles SIGINT and closes without deadlocking

- [#1278](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1278) Fixed inflated values problem with `sum()` on Thanos Query

- [#1280](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1280) Fixed a problem with concurrent writes to a `map` in Thanos Query while rendering the UI

- [#1311](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1311) Fixed occasional panics in Compact and Store when using Azure Blob cloud storage caused by lack of error checking in client library.

- [#1322](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1322) Removed duplicated closing of the gRPC listener - this gets rid of harmless messages like `store gRPC listener: close tcp 0.0.0.0:10901: use of closed network connection` when those programs are being closed

### Deprecated

- [#1216](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1216) the old "Command-line flags" has been removed from Thanos Query UI since it was not populated and because we are striving for consistency

## [v0.5.0](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/releases/tag/v0.5.0) - 2019.06.05

TL;DR: Store LRU cache is no longer leaking, Upgraded Thanos UI to Prometheus 2.9, Fixed auto-downsampling, Moved to Go 1.12.5 and more.

This version moved tarballs to Golang 1.12.5 from 1.11 as well, so same warning applies if you use `container_memory_usage_bytes` from cadvisor. Use `container_memory_working_set_bytes` instead.

*breaking* As announced couple of times this release also removes gossip with all configuration flags (`--cluster.*`).

### Fixed

- [#1142](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1142) fixed major leak on store LRU cache for index items (postings and series).
- [#1163](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1163) sidecar is no longer blocking for custom Prometheus versions/builds. It only checks if flags return non 404, then it performs optional checks.
- [#1146](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1146) store/bucket: make getFor() work with interleaved resolutions.
- [#1157](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1157) querier correctly handles duplicated stores when some store changes external labels in place.

### Added

- [#1094](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1094) Allow configuring the response header timeout for the S3 client.

### Changed

- [#1118](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1118) *breaking* swift: Added support for cross-domain authentication by introducing `userDomainID`, `userDomainName`, `projectDomainID`, `projectDomainName`.
  The outdated terms `tenantID`, `tenantName` are deprecated and have been replaced by `projectID`, `projectName`.

- [#1066](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1066) Upgrade Thanos ui to Prometheus v2.9.1.

## Deprecated

- [#1008](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1008) *breaking* Removed Gossip implementation. All `--cluster.*` flags removed and Thanos will error out if any is provided.

## [v0.4.0](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/releases/tag/v0.4.0) - 2019.05.3

:warning: **IMPORTANT** :warning: This is the last release that supports gossip. From Thanos v0.5.0, gossip will be completely removed.

This release also disables gossip mode by default for all components.
See [this](docs/proposals/completed/201809_gossip-removal.md) for more details.

:warning: This release moves Thanos docker images (NOT artifacts by accident) to Golang 1.12. This release includes change in GC's memory release which gives following effect (source: https://golang.org/doc/go1.12):

> On Linux, the runtime now uses MADV_FREE to release unused memory. This is more efficient but may result in higher reported RSS. The kernel will reclaim the unused data when it is needed. To revert to the Go 1.11 behavior (MADV_DONTNEED), set the environment variable GODEBUG=madvdontneed=1.

If you want to see exact memory allocation of Thanos process:
* Use `go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes` metric exposed by Golang or `container_memory_working_set_bytes` exposed by cadvisor.
* Add `GODEBUG=madvdontneed=1` before running Thanos binary to revert to memory releasing to pre 1.12 logic.

Using cadvisor `container_memory_usage_bytes` metric could be misleading e.g: https://github.com/google/cadvisor/issues/2242

### Added

- [thanos.io](https://thanos.io) website & automation :tada:
- [#1053](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1053) compactor: Compactor & store gateway now handles incomplete uploads gracefully. Added hard limit on how long block upload can take (30m).
- [#811](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/811) Remote write receiver component :heart: :heart: thanks to RedHat (@brancz) contribution.
- [#910](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/910) Query's stores UI page is now sorted by type and old DNS or File SD stores are removed after 5 minutes (configurable via the new `--store.unhealthy-timeout=5m` flag).
- [#905](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/905) Thanos support for Query API: /api/v1/labels. Notice that the API was added in Prometheus v2.6.
- [#798](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/798) Ability to limit the maximum number of concurrent request to Series() calls in Thanos Store and the maximum amount of samples we handle.
- [#1060](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1060) Allow specifying region attribute in S3 storage configuration

:warning: **WARNING** :warning: #798 adds a new default limit to Thanos Store: `--store.grpc.series-max-concurrency`. Most likely you will want to make it the same as `--query.max-concurrent` on Thanos Query.

New options:

  New Store flags:

    * `--store.grpc.series-sample-limit` limits the amount of samples that might be retrieved on a single Series() call. By default it is 0. Consider enabling it by setting it to more than 0 if you are running on limited resources.
    * `--store.grpc.series-max-concurrency` limits the number of concurrent Series() calls in Thanos Store. By default it is 20. Considering making it lower or bigger depending on the scale of your deployment.

  New Store metrics:

    * `thanos_bucket_store_queries_dropped_total` shows how many queries were dropped due to the samples limit;
    * `thanos_bucket_store_queries_concurrent_max` is a constant metric which shows how many Series() calls can concurrently be executed by Thanos Store;
    * `thanos_bucket_store_queries_in_flight` shows how many queries are currently "in flight" i.e. they are being executed;
    * `thanos_bucket_store_gate_duration_seconds` shows how many seconds it took for queries to pass through the gate in both cases - when that fails and when it does not.

  New Store tracing span:
    * `store_query_gate_ismyturn` shows how long it took for a query to pass (or not) through the gate.

- [#1016](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1016) Added option for another DNS resolver (miekg/dns client).
Note that this is required to have SRV resolution working on [Golang 1.11+ with KubeDNS below v1.14](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/27546)

   New Querier and Ruler flag: `-- store.sd-dns-resolver` which allows to specify resolver to use. Either `golang` or `miekgdns`

- [#986](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/986) Allow to save some startup & sync time in store gateway as it is no longer needed to compute index-cache from block index on its own for larger blocks.
  The store Gateway still can do it, but it first checks bucket if there is index-cached uploaded already.
  In the same time, compactor precomputes the index cache file on every compaction.

  New Compactor flag: `--index.generate-missing-cache-file` was added to allow quicker addition of index cache files. If enabled it precomputes missing files on compactor startup. Note that it will take time and it's only one-off step per bucket.

- [#887](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/887) Compact: Added new `--block-sync-concurrency` flag, which allows you to configure number of goroutines to use when syncing block metadata from object storage.
- [#928](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/928) Query: Added `--store.response-timeout` flag. If a Store doesn't send any data in this specified duration then a Store will be ignored and partial data will be returned if it's enabled. 0 disables timeout.
- [#893](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/893) S3 storage backend has graduated to `stable` maturity level.
- [#936](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/936) Azure storage backend has graduated to `stable` maturity level.
- [#937](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/937) S3: added trace functionality. You can add `trace.enable: true` to enable the minio client's verbose logging.
- [#953](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/953) Compact: now has a hidden flag `--debug.accept-malformed-index`. Compaction index verification will ignore out of order label names.
- [#963](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/963) GCS: added possibility to inline ServiceAccount into GCS config.
- [#1010](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1010) Compact: added new flag `--compact.concurrency`. Number of goroutines to use when compacting groups.
- [#1028](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1028) Query: added `--query.default-evaluation-interval`, which sets default evaluation interval for sub queries.
- [#980](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/980) Ability to override Azure storage endpoint for other regions (China)
- [#1021](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1021) Query API `series` now supports POST method.
- [#939](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/939) Query API `query_range` now supports POST method.

### Changed

- [#970](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/970) Deprecated `partial_response_disabled` proto field. Added `partial_response_strategy` instead. Both in gRPC and Query API.
  No `PartialResponseStrategy` field for `RuleGroups` by default means `abort` strategy (old PartialResponse disabled) as this is recommended option for Rules and alerts.

  Metrics:

    * Added `thanos_rule_evaluation_with_warnings_total` to Ruler.
    * DNS `thanos_ruler_query_apis*` are now `thanos_ruler_query_apis_*` for consistency.
    * DNS `thanos_querier_store_apis*` are now `thanos_querier_store_apis__*` for consistency.
    * Query Gate `thanos_bucket_store_series*` are now `thanos_bucket_store_series_*` for consistency.
    * Most of thanos ruler metris related to rule manager has `strategy` label.

  Ruler tracing spans:

    * `/rule_instant_query HTTP[client]` is now `/rule_instant_query_part_resp_abort HTTP[client]"` if request is for abort strategy.

- [#1009](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1009): Upgraded Prometheus (~v2.7.0-rc.0 to v2.8.1)  and TSDB (`v0.4.0` to `v0.6.1`) deps.

  Changes that affects Thanos:
   * query:
     * [ENHANCEMENT] In histogram_quantile merge buckets with equivalent le values. #5158.
     * [ENHANCEMENT] Show list of offending labels in the error message in many-to-many scenarios. #5189

     * [BUGFIX] prometheus_rule_group_last_duration_seconds now reports seconds instead of nanoseconds. Fixes our [issue #1027](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/1027)
     * [BUGFIX] Fix sorting of rule groups. #5260
   * store: [ENHANCEMENT] Fast path for EmptyPostings cases in Merge, Intersect and Without.
   * tooling: [FEATURE] New dump command to tsdb tool to dump all samples.
   * compactor:
      * [ENHANCEMENT] When closing the db any running compaction will be cancelled so it doesn't block.
      * [CHANGE] *breaking* Renamed flag `--sync-delay` to `--consistency-delay` [#1053](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1053)

  For ruler essentially whole TSDB CHANGELOG applies beween v0.4.0-v0.6.1: https://github.com/prometheus/tsdb/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

  Note that this was added on TSDB and Prometheus: [FEATURE] Time-ovelapping blocks are now allowed. #370
  Whoever due to nature of Thanos compaction (distributed systems), for safety reason this is disabled for Thanos compactor for now.

- [#868](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/868) Go has been updated to 1.12.

## [v0.3.2](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/releases/tag/v0.3.2) - 2019.03.04

### Added

- [#851](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/851) New read API endpoint for api/v1/rules and api/v1/alerts.
- [#873](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/873) Store: fix set index cache LRU

:warning: **WARNING** :warning: #873 fix fixes actual handling of `index-cache-size`. Handling of limit for this cache was
broken so it was unbounded all the time. From this release actual value matters and is extremely low by default. To "revert"
the old behaviour (no boundary), use a large enough value.

### Fixed

- [#833](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/833) Store Gateway matcher regression for intersecting with empty posting.
- [#867](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/867) Fixed race condition in sidecare between reloader and shipper.

    - prometheus/prometheus/rules:
      - New metrics exposed! (prometheus evaluation!)
      - [ENHANCEMENT] Rules: Error out at load time for invalid templates, rather than at evaluation time. #4537
    - prometheus/tsdb/index: Index reader optimizations.
- Thanos store gateway flag for sync concurrency (`block-sync-concurrency` with `20` default, so no change by default)
- S3 provider:
  - Added `put_user_metadata` option to config.
  - Added `insecure_skip_verify` option to config.

### Deprecated

- Tests against Prometheus below v2.2.1. This does not mean *lack* of support for those. Only that we don't tests the compatibility anymore. See [#758](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/758) for details.

## [v0.2.1](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/releases/tag/v0.2.1) - 2018.12.27

### Added

- Relabel drop for Thanos Ruler to enable replica label drop and alert deduplication on AM side.
- Query: Stores UI page available at `/stores`.

### Fixed

- Thanos Rule Alertmanager DNS SD bug.
- DNS SD bug when having SRV results with different ports.
- Move handling of HA alertmanagers to be the same as Prometheus.
- Azure iteration implementation flaw.

## [v0.2.0](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/releases/tag/v0.2.0) - 2018.12.10

Next Thanos release adding support to new discovery method, gRPC mTLS and two new object store providers (Swift and Azure).

Note lots of necessary breaking changes in flags that relates to bucket configuration.

### Deprecated

- *breaking*: Removed all bucket specific flags as we moved to config files:
    - --gcs-bucket=\<bucket\>
    - --s3.bucket=\<bucket\>
    - --s3.endpoint=\<api-url\>
    - --s3.access-key=\<key\>
    - --s3.insecure
    - --s3.signature-version2
    - --s3.encrypt-sse
    - --gcs-backup-bucket=\<bucket\>
    - --s3-backup-bucket=\<bucket\>
- *breaking*: Removed support of those environment variables for bucket:
    * S3_BUCKET
    * S3_ENDPOINT
    * S3_ACCESS_KEY
    * S3_INSECURE
    * S3_SIGNATURE_VERSION2
- *breaking*: Removed provider specific bucket metrics e.g `thanos_objstore_gcs_bucket_operations_total` in favor of of generic bucket operation metrics.

### Changed

- *breaking*: Added `thanos_` prefix to memberlist (gossip) metrics. Make sure to update your dashboards and rules.
- S3 provider:
  - Set `"X-Amz-Acl": "bucket-owner-full-control"` metadata for s3 upload operation.

### Added

- Support for heterogeneous secure gRPC on StoreAPI.
- Handling of scalar result in rule node evaluating rules.
- Flag `--objstore.config-file` to reference to the bucket configuration file in yaml format. Detailed information can be found in document [storage](docs/storage.md).
- File service discovery for StoreAPIs:
- In `thanos rule`, static configuration of query nodes via `--query`
- In `thanos rule`, file based discovery of query nodes using `--query.file-sd-config.files`
- In `thanos query`, file based discovery of store nodes using `--store.file-sd-config.files`
- `/-/healthy` endpoint to Querier.
- DNS service discovery to static and file based configurations using the `dns+` and `dnssrv+` prefixes for the respective lookup. Details [here](docs/service-discovery.md)
- `--cluster.disable` flag to disable gossip functionality completely.
- Hidden flag to configure max compaction level.
- Azure Storage.
- OpenStack Swift support.
- Thanos Ruler `thanos_rule_loaded_rules` metric.
- Option for JSON logger format.

### Fixed

- Issue whereby the Proxy Store could end up in a deadlock if there were more than 9 stores being queried and all returned an error.
- Ruler tracing causing panics.
- GatherIndexStats panics on duplicated chunks check.
- Clean up of old compact blocks on compact restart.
- Sidecar too frequent Prometheus reload.
- `thanos_compactor_retries_total` metric not being registered.
